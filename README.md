WordPress Easy Custom Error Pages
=========================

This plugin dynamically creates pages for the most common error codes. It generates page templates for each error code from within your themes current page.php tempalate file and assisgns each new page template to the appropriate error page. It then updates your HTACCESS file with the correct references to these new pages.

In the event of moving your WordPress installtion into another directory, please note you will need to delete your HTACCESS file and resave it again.
